## What is it?

YouTube Clarity replaces the busy YouTube homepage with a focused, distraction‑free search screen. Type what you want, press Enter, and get on with your day — without falling into recommendations.

> ⚠️ Independent project. Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to YouTube or Google.

## What it does

- **Clean dark background**: No visual clutter — just pure focus
- **Centered search bar**: Find exactly what you need instantly
- **Real YouTube suggestions**: Autocomplete as you type
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys + Enter for fast searches
- **Seamless experience**: Only the homepage changes; watch pages work normally

## How it works

1. Install the extension
2. Go to `youtube.com`
3. See the clean search interface instead of the recommendation feed
4. Search intentionally and stay on track
5. All other pages (videos, channels, search results) behave normally
