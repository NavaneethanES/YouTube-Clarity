YouTube Clarity collects NO personal data.



• The extension only reads the search query you type in the overlay.

• That query is sent directly to Google’s public suggestion endpoint[](https://suggestqueries.google.com) to provide autocomplete — exactly like the official YouTube search bar.

• No analytics, tracking pixels, or third-party services are used.

• All code runs locally; nothing is stored or transmitted to any server other than YouTube’s own suggestion API.



Permissions explained:

- "activeTab": injects the overlay only on YouTube tabs.

- "https://www.youtube.com/*": runs the content script on YouTube.

- "https://suggestqueries.google.com/*": fetches autocomplete suggestions.



No user data is collected, stored, or shared.
